Once you have created and wired the TaskScheduler you will need to create runnable tasks for it to execute.

Create the following task

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/tasks/demo/EmailTask.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/tasks/demo/EmailTask.groovy[]
----
<1> Implement `Runnable`
<2> Store incoming email address for later use
<3> Store incoming message
<4> Store incoming service
<5> Task constructor: set email and service
<6> Run the task
